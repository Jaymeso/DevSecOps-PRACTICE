# DevSecOps-PRACTICE
A DevSecOps practice - embedding security within DevOps and automation processes.

# 🔐 DevSecOps Practice  

This repository showcases how to **embed security within DevOps pipelines and automation processes** — creating a practical **DevSecOps practice** that balances speed, resilience, and compliance.  

---

## 🚀 Overview  

Modern software delivery requires **security by design**. This repo demonstrates:  
- 📦 Secure Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) with Terraform scanning  
- 🐳 Container image hardening and vulnerability scanning  
- 🔄 CI/CD pipeline integrations with automated SAST/DAST  
- 📊 Governance mappings (e.g., NIST CSF, DORA) to show compliance  
- ⚡ Security as Code: policy enforcement baked into pipelines  

---

## 📂 What’s Inside  

- **pipeline-examples/** → GitHub Actions & GitLab CI/CD pipelines with SAST/DAST  
- **IaC-security/** → Terraform IAM configs + automated scans (Checkov, tfsec)  
- **container-security/** → Hardened Dockerfile + vulnerability scans (Trivy, Snyk)  
- **docs/** → Explanations, tool comparisons, and governance links  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques  

- **SAST:** Semgrep, SonarQube, CodeQL  
- **DAST:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite CI  
- **Container Security:** Trivy, Snyk, Anchore  
- **IaC Scanning:** Checkov, tfsec  
- **Pipeline Platforms:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins

## 📊 Governance & Compliance  

This practice maps technical controls to governance requirements:  

| Control Area        | Tool/Technique           | Framework Link |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Identity & Access   | Terraform IAM + Checkov  | NIST CSF PR.AC |
| Vulnerability Mgmt  | Trivy/Snyk scans         | DORA Article 6 |
| Secure SDLC         | CodeQL, SonarQube        | ISO 27034      |
| Continuous Testing  | OWASP ZAP CI             | NIST CSF DE.CM |
